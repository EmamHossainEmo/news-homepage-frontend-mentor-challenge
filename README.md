## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot from designing my first navigation bar. Toggling the nav bar, in particular, was a valuable experience that allowed me to grasp the importance of user-friendly navigation. Additionally, I gained significant insight into responsive design, ensuring that the navigation bar adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

Really like this simple function:

```js
function toggleNav() {
  navEl.classList.toggle("hide-nav");
}
```
